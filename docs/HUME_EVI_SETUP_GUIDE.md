## 🎭 **How the Emotional Intelligence Works**

### **Voice Analysis**
```javascript
// Real-time emotional detection
const emotions = {
  calm: 0.8,      // 80% calm
  anxiety: 0.2,   // 20% anxious  
  distress: 0.1,  // 10% distressed
  hope: 0.6       // 60% hopeful
}
```

### **Crisis Detection**
```javascript
// Automatic crisis intervention triggers
const crisisIndicators = {
  textual: ["want to die", "hopeless", "suicide"],
  emotional: ["despair", "overwhelming_sadness"],  
  vocal: ["trembling_voice", "hyperventilation"]
}
```

### **Empathic Responses** 
```javascript
// Trauma-informed response examples
"I hear the pain in your voice, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely valid."
"You're safe here with me. We can pause anytime you need to."
"I can hear your strength even in this difficult moment."
```
