### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
const eviConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.HUME_API_KEY,
  configId: 'ptsd-coach-config',
  voiceId: 'empathic-therapist-voice',
  functions: [
    {
      name: 'trigger_grounding_technique',
      description: 'Start a grounding exercise when distress is detected',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          technique: { type: 'string', enum: ['breathing', '5-4-3-2-1', 'progressive_muscle'] },
          intensity: { type: 'string', enum: ['mild', 'moderate', 'severe'] }
        }

          recommendation: { type: 'string' }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

### Emotional Response Handling
```javascript
// Real-time emotion processing
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  switch (message.type) {
    case 'user_message':
      const emotions = message.vocal_expressions;
      analyzeEmotionalState(emotions);
      checkForCrisisIndicators(message.text, emotions);
      break;
      
    case 'assistant_message':
      displayEmpathicResponse(message.content);
      break;
      
    case 'function_call':
      executeTherapeuticFunction(message.function_call);
      break;
  }
};
```

## 🎭 Emotional Intelligence Features

### Crisis Detection Algorithms
```javascript
const crisisIndicators = {
  vocal: ['trembling', 'breaking_voice', 'hyperventilation', 'silence_patterns'],
  textual: ['want to die', 'end it all', 'no point', 'hopeless', 'suicide'],
  emotional: ['despair', 'hopelessness', 'overwhelming_sadness', 'panic']
};

function detectCrisis(voiceData, textData, emotionData) {
  const riskScore = calculateRiskScore(voiceData, textData, emotionData);
  
  if (riskScore > 0.8) {
    return triggerImmediateIntervention();
  } else if (riskScore > 0.5) {
    return provideIntensiveSupport();
  }
  
  return continueNormalSession();
}
```

### Empathic Response Generation
```javascript
const traumaInformedPrompts = {
  validation: "I hear the pain in your voice, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely valid.",
  safety: "You're safe here with me. We can pause anytime you need to.",
  strength: "I can hear your strength even in this difficult moment. You've survived so much already.",
  hope: "Healing is possible, and you don't have to do this alone."
};

function generateEmpathicResponse(emotionalState, content) {
  const prompt = `
    You are Coach Sarah, a trauma-informed PTSD specialist. 
    Current user emotional state: ${emotionalState}
    Respond with deep empathy, validation, and trauma-informed care.
    If distress detected, provide grounding support.
    CRITICAL: If any crisis indicators, immediately provide crisis resources.
  `;
  
  return callEVI(prompt, content);
}
```
